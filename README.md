Server
The server infrastructure of RedWaveTube is designed to maintain control and order. Two separate servers handle different functionalities:

Authentication Server: Ensures secure generation and delivery of temporary passwords during the login process.
Operations Server: Manages video downloading, extraction of video thumbnails, follow functionalities, playlist creation, processing video information requests, and more.
To protect our data, we employ advanced encryption techniques such as AES and RSA. User passwords and essential information are securely hashed to prevent unauthorized access.

Client
The client interface is the face of RedWaveTube, providing users with access to a variety of functions. Users can play videos, share content, follow others, view popular and recommended videos, and more. Premium status, achieved through a unique challenge, unlocks additional features such as enhanced social interaction capabilities.

Recommendation Engine
The recommendation engine, a critical component of our system, utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate personalized video recommendations. This ensures that our comrades are always engaged with relevant and approved content.

Database
Our comprehensive database stores a wide range of information, including user credentials, content metadata, playlists, user interactions, and more. With over 588,000 unique video IDs, our database is a testament to our dedication to maintaining a rich and controlled repository of content.
